## Prerequisites: Install a Web3 Wallet

Before starting the airdrop claim process, you must have a Web3 wallet installed. A Web3 wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to interact with blockchain applications and store your cryptocurrency assets.

The platform currently supports three wallet connection options:

- **MetaMask** - Browser extension wallet (most common for desktop users)
- **Coinbase Wallet** - Coinbase's self-custody wallet
- **WalletConnect** - Protocol that connects mobile wallets via QR code scanning


> **Note - Security Warning**:
>
> - Only download wallets from official websites to avoid malicious fake extensions.
> - Your private key and seed phrase (recovery phrase) are the **only** ways to access your wallet. If lost or compromised:
>     - ❌ You will **not** be able to claim remaining airdrop allocations
>     - ❌ You will **not** be able to recover tokens already claimed to that wallet
>     - ❌ There is **no** recovery option - not even the project team can help
