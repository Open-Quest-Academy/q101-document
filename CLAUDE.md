# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the documentation repository for q101.org - the official website and portal for the Q101 utility and governance token. The repository contains documentation about the Q101 token ecosystem, Open Quest Academy educational platform, and the Q101 Foundation.

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-only repository with a single README.md file that serves as the primary documentation source. The content describes:

- Q101 token purpose and utility (learning incentives, governance rights, ecosystem growth)
- Open Quest Academy platform (AI-driven education, decentralized learning)
- Q101 Foundation governance and responsibilities
- Strategic partnerships (particularly with Mynd.ai)
- Token distribution and airdrop programs

## Git Workflow

- **Main branch**: `master` (production documentation)
- Recent commits show documentation improvements focused on accuracy and consistency
- Changes should maintain the established structure and tone

## Documentation Guidelines

When updating documentation in this repository:

1. **Accuracy**: Ensure all claims are verifiable and factual
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology throughout (Q101 token, Open Quest Academy, Q101 Foundation)
3. **Structure**: Follow the existing section hierarchy (Overview, Mission, Token, Academy, Foundation, etc.)
4. **Clarity**: Write for multiple audiences (learners, educators, investors, partners)
5. **Links**: Keep resource links functional and up-to-date

## Key Terminology

- **Q101 Token**: The utility and governance token for the ecosystem
- **Open Quest Academy (Open-Q)**: The AI-driven education platform
- **Q101 Foundation**: The governance entity managing the token and ecosystem
- **Mynd.ai**: Exclusive operating partner for North America

## Content Focus Areas

The documentation covers three main pillars:

1. **Token Ecosystem**: Utility, governance, distribution mechanisms
2. **Educational Platform**: AI-powered learning, global accessibility, interactive technology
3. **Foundation Governance**: Strategic partnerships, token management, educational equity

When making updates, ensure changes align with the mission of democratized learning, incentivized education, community governance, and global collaboration.
